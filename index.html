    <h2>IT and me</h2>
    <h3>How it all started...</h3>
    <p>
        I am a millennial, lucky enough to own a computer at a very early age.
        From a little girl exploring how her computer worked in DOS to a young woman, and her passion for forums, blogs, chatrooms, messengers...
        my curiosity has been kept alive throughout the years by my fascination for understanding what lies beyond this wonderful, interactive, universe.
        I have been studying throughout the years a bit of coding and databases (Javascipt, Java, mySQL) and recently I felt the need to return to it, and this time to build a career in it. 
        This is when I decided to join Code Nation and to dwelve in what they had to offer in order to equip myself with all the skills to become a successful developer.
    </p>
    <h3>Now and beyond</h3>
    <p>
        I learnt some Python, Html, Ccc in the first training I attended. I also developed a text based game and a website.
        Then I attended a Cyber Security course, in which I learnt the fundamentals skills necessary to protect a system, and I built and implemented my own security system.
        I am now focusing on deepening my understa of Javascript, Html, Css, Git, and to get familiar with Agile practices and Kanban style. 
        On my own, I have also delved a bit deeper in the way Git works, and I have gained some basic understanding of some of the services provided by AWS, such as IAM, S3, and Route 53.
        I would love in the future to pair this knowledge to a wider understanding of the DevOps way of working, and focusing my career on it.
